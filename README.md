The main screen is composed of 2 main areas. The ribbon at the top exposed controls for managing the application and specific servers. 
The lower part contains a list of servers.

Enter the values required and click Ok. 

If you need to edit a server, if e.g. the server password has changed, you select the server in the list, and click "Edit Server". 
The same windows as above is shown, this time with the data entered. 

If you wish to delete a server from the list, simply select it, and click "Delete Server".
